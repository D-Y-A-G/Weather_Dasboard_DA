Details: Creating a Weather Dashboard using https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api to retrieve current forecast data for city input on search bar and include a 5 day forecast.

Introduction:

For this week's homework I was challenged to create a weather dashboard where user could input a city in US and would be given the current weather for the city along with the 5 day forecast. This acitivity was a lot of fun and also challenging, my biggest challenge was getting the API data to present to user by specifying the correct path of items requested. I learned a lot about using API's and the different ways to request specific data and being able to use functions within functions as well as getting more familiar with FETCH.

<stron>Instructions:</strong>
On page load user is presented with a weather application. User inputs city that they would like to check current for cast and 5 day weather onsearch bar, then user is presented
with temperature, wind, UV index and humidity level along with a future 5 day forecast.
